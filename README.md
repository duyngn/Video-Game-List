# Video Game Tracker

This is a quick over-the-weekend project as a code test for ENVOY.  This test is no longer applicable at the organization.  I'm keeping this around just for keepsake reminder. :)

 - The app is intended to let users keep track of games they've played. 
 - It allows the user to add a game to an SQlite database with a title, the
   console the game is on, and an image (could be from camera). 
  - Once  the game is in the database, the user can manage it such as delete, mark game as completed and also rate it out of a 5 star rating scale.
